01) Web api
As a web API we are collecting all the Bus- and Trainstations from Switzerland. The notebook and Output can
be found in the folder 'Geocoding Stations'.

02) Web Scraping
We scraped the available Buildings (apartments and houses) of Switzerland from the Webpage 'Homegate'.

03) Tax Rates
We use the xslx file 'estv_income_rates.xslx' to load the Cantonal Tax Rates and Municipal Tax Rates of all Cantons. In the 'Preparing and Storing Data' Sequence we additionally created a new variable 'steuersatz_kombiniert', which is the sum of the Cantonal and Municipal Tax Rate.

04) BfS Table
As the apartments and buildings are scraped with the PLZ and the Tax Rates include the BfS Nr, we use the csv file 'PLZ_BFS.csv' to match the scraped data with the Tax Rates.
